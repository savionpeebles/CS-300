# CS-300
What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

In this course we were dealing with multiple different data structures such as Hash Tables, Binary Trees and Linked Lists, the main purpose was to understand how these strucutres work and we as software developers can use then to make our jobs easier and our programs more effecient.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I approached this problem by trying to weigh the pros and cons to each data structure as we developed our knowledge with them, as we developed more it was clear that certain strucutres were made for certain sitations depending on what the user, client and developer need.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

I overcame a lot of my roadblocks for projects and assignments by using resources provided to me like the website Geeks4Geeks and also watching youtube videos on the data strucutres I was struggling with. Intially in the class a lot of my issues were technical so once that was straightened out it became a lot easier to focus on the course material and drive home the understanding.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

The work i've done on these projects gives me an insight of how data structures can be used in our real world application once school is over, things like the Big-O runtime analysis showed me how certain strucutres can be better suited for certain situations.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This project has allowed my development skills to grow just based off of the practice and introduction to new material as well as some concepts from the past returning to me. Seeing how interconnected things can be it would be ideal to reuse some code at times where it will heighten effeciency and save time for the developer themselves.
